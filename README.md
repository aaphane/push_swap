# push_swap
A sorting algo project using two stack. 
It is made up of 2 programs.
The first, named checker which takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output.
Once read, checker executes them and displays "OK" if integers are sorted.
Otherwise, it will display "KO". The second one called push_swap which calculates and displays on 
the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.
